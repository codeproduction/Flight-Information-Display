# Flight Information Display (FIDS) Project

## About the Application (Task 2)

**What will the application do?**  

- It will display Flights and information related to their departure and arrival timings.
- It will display simple statistics regarding the performance of the flights
- It can be edited by the airport staff in order to update status of Flights and also to add or remove Flights
- It will display the current time, and possibly time in the GMT 0 time zone
- It will be useful for hotels with large amount of guests staying for short period of time

**Who will use it?**

- Airport staffing and management companies and authorities will use it
- Hotels close to or in airports could also use it for facilitation of guests.
- It is ultimately designed to benefit air passengers at airports
- It will simultaneously benefit airport operations authorities too by increasing passenger-handling efficiency

- It particularly interests me as I have a long-held interest in planes and passion for aviation
